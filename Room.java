 * "World of Zuul" is a very simple, text based adventure game.  
 *
 * A "Room" represents one location in the scenery of the game.  It is 
 * connected to other rooms via exits.  For each existing exit, the room 
 * stores a reference to the neighboring room. The room can also be locked.
 * 
 * Rooms can have items or characters stored in them. They may also be used to teleport to other rooms.
