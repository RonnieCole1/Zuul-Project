Project 3 Description:

Board a space ship. Fight some guards. Take a repair tool and use it on the ship's engines (to repair them). Go to bridge.

		Here are the following commands:

Take - allows you to pick up a grabable item that isn't too heavy.
Inspect - shows you what items you have in your inventory.
Drop - drops an item from your inventory and adds it to the room.
Look - gives a description of the room you are in.
Quit - quits the game.
Go - allows you to move to a room so long as there is a door.
Use - allows the player to use special functions that are given to a usable item.
Inspectitem - reads description from item your either carrying or in your room.
Back - sends you back to the previous room.

Unfortunately, I can't get roomList to not break the game, and some methods require it to work. I also didn't have time to get
the other characters to fire back. Assuming roomList works, here is the list of commands that need to be done in order to win:

1.  take Rifle
2.  take HackingTool
3.  go north
4.  use HackingTool
5.  go north
6.  go north
7.  use Rifle
8.  take keycard
9.  go west
10. use Rifle
11. take RepairTool
12. use RepairTool
13. go east
14. use keycard
15. go east
16. go east
